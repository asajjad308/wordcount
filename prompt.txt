Create a complete, single-page static web app for a **Free Online Word Counter Tool** using HTML, CSS (with Tailwind CSS via CDN for simplicity), and vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks like React unless needed for very light state). The tool should be fast, mobile-responsive, accessible, and optimized for SEO and ad revenue.

Key requirements:

1. **Main Functionality** (real-time as user types/pastes):
   - Large textarea for input (placeholder: "Paste or type your text here...")
   - Instantly display (live updating):
     - Words count
     - Characters (with spaces)
     - Characters (without spaces)
     - Sentences count
     - Paragraphs count
     - Reading time estimate (average 200-250 words per minute, show in minutes & seconds, e.g., "About 3 min 12 sec")
   - All counters update in real-time on every keystroke or paste (use 'input' event)

2. **Extra useful stats** (to differentiate from competitors like wordcounter.net, Grammarly word counter, wordcounter.io):
   - Average words per sentence
   - Top 5 most frequent words (ignore common stop words like "the", "and", "a", "is", "in", "of", etc. – provide a small stop words list in code)
   - Keyword density for the top word (percentage)

3. **UI/UX Design**:
   - Clean, modern, minimal design (white/dark mode toggle optional but nice)
   - Big centered textarea at top (min-height 300px, full-width on mobile)
   - Stats displayed in elegant cards or a clean grid below the textarea (e.g., 3-4 columns on desktop, stacked on mobile)
   - Use large, readable fonts and green accents for counts
   - Include a "Clear Text" button
   - "Copy Stats" button to copy all counts to clipboard
   - Very fast load (<1s), excellent Core Web Vitals (no heavy libs)

4. **SEO Optimization** (critical for ranking on "free word counter online", "word count tool", "online word counter free" etc.):
   - Proper semantic HTML (h1, main, section)
   - Meta tags: title = "Free Online Word Counter – Count Words, Characters & Reading Time"
   - Meta description: "Instant free word counter tool. Count words, characters (with/without spaces), sentences, paragraphs, and estimated reading time. No sign-up, real-time results. Perfect for essays, blogs, and writers."
   - Open Graph tags for social sharing
   - Add a short explanatory section below stats: "Why use our word counter? Accurate real-time counting, no ads in the way (but support us with non-intrusive ads), privacy-focused (no data stored), works offline after first load."
   - H2/H3 headings like "How to Use the Word Counter", "Features", "Frequently Asked Questions" with 4-5 simple Q&A (e.g., "Is this word counter free? Yes, 100% free forever.")
   - Make it PWA-capable (basic manifest + service worker stub if easy)

5. **Ad Placement Hooks** (non-intrusive, high-revenue potential):
   - Leave clear spaces: 
     - Horizontal banner below textarea (id="ad-banner-top")
     - Sidebar or bottom rectangle for display ads (id="ad-sidebar" or id="ad-bottom")
     - After stats section: another horizontal slot
   - Comment where to insert Google AdSense, Ezoic, or Mediavine code

6. **Performance & Compatibility**:
   - Use Tailwind CSS CDN only (no build step needed for Vercel/Netlify deploy)
   - Pure vanilla JS, no external dependencies except Tailwind
   - Mobile-first responsive design
   - Dark mode support (via prefers-color-scheme or toggle)
   - Handle very large text (up to 100k+ characters) without lag

7. **Bonus Polish**:
   - Show "Paste detected" toast briefly when user pastes
   - Export stats as simple text (optional button)
   - Footer with: "© 2026 YourName | Free Word Counter Tool | Privacy Policy | Contact"

Output the complete code in one file (index.html) with embedded <style> (Tailwind) and <script>. Make it production-ready for free deployment on Vercel or Netlify. Comment the code clearly, especially ad slots and SEO parts.
